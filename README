Example is based on:

https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/Source:-Bouncing-ball

## Building

For Ubuntu 18.04 I made a helper docker container to assist in building to
avoid having conflicts with system ffmpeg stuff.

    make libs  # to build ffmpeg and x264 codec (and installs this to `libs`)

    make example  # build the example program (not build within docker)

## Running

    ./example


## Known issues

I've tried for a long time but for now given up on supporting an audio channel.
It would be fun to generate some sound effects whenever the ball hits a wall
for example however I struggled to get this stuff in sync.
With an old ffmpeg version I managed to get this interleaving working, but I
don't want to downgrade ffmpeg for this feature right now.
