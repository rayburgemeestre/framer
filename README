Example is based on:

https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/Source:-Bouncing-ball

I've tried for a long time but for now given up on supporting an audio channel.
It would be fun to generate some sound effects whenever the ball hits a wall
for example however I struggled to get this stuff in sync.
With an old ffmpeg version I managed to get this interleaving working, but I
don't want to downgrade ffmpeg for this feature right now.
